# GMD1-SemesterGameProject
### YouTube video demo ~2 min.

- There's a lot material that the course touches on. The truth is that it is very unlikely that I'd ever have time to get through all of it and play to get any sufficient profficency. However, skimming through the materials already gives some sort of orientation what is what, and opens the eyes for potential utilization of particualr features. Later in the project - once we find they are necessary - we can simply come back to them and look at them closer.
