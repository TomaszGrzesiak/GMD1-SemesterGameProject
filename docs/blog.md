# 1: Roll-a-ball tutorial, 17-02-2025
## First day of game dev!
I'm excited to learn and play with game developement.
It's interesting for many reasons, but mainly: 
- it's a mix of wide range of domains, f.x. MDA - in of it self already encompasses lots of fields that one has to take into consideration during game dev
- it's a creative endavour - meaning - we can "unleash" some creativity and express ourselves in various manners - definately more than in most of other courses
- it develops our skillset towards interactive media in general
- it's fun to be in this class :)

## Roll-a-ball
The showcase and promises looks decent. The skillset and experience we should acquire during the tutorial seems very useful, even foundational in the lens of upcoming tasks.

Unfortunately, it the website stopped working after ~30 min. I see the following message:

Available counterpart tutorials on YouTube are ~9 years old. Too much.

However, ChatGPT is ready to assist and draw a helping hand in such instance.
Let's see how far I can get with it!
And let's hope Unity website is up again soon :)
