# 1: Roll-a-ball tutorial, 17-02-2025
## First day of game dev!
I'm excited to learn and play with game developement.
It's interesting for many reasons, but mainly:
- it's a mix of wide range of domains, f.x. MDA - in of it self already encompasses lots of fields that one has to take into consideration during game dev
- it's a creative endavour - meaning - we can "unleash" some creativity and express ourselves in various manners - definately more than in most of other courses
- it develops our skillset towards interactive media in general
- it's fun to be in this class :)

## Time:
**~4-5 hours** - including some extra insights and updating the blog.
**And ~1-2 h to setup GitHub repo and the starting the blog** (GitHub pages) according to the assignmnet requirements. It took so long, because I was trying to make it fancy. It didn't work out though  (╥﹏╥).
**Building** the app takes ages! First build to .exe file = **3-4 mins**.
**Building to **webGL****... at this moment it's **10 mins**, and still going.

## Roll-a-ball

### Beginings
I tried to follow the tutorial:
https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball
. The showcase and promises look decent. The skillset and experience I should acquire during the tutorial seem very useful, even foundational in the lens of upcoming tasks.

Unfortunately, it the website stopped working after ~30 min. I can only see the following message:

Available counterpart tutorials on YouTube are ~9 years old. Too much.

Now I have to wait until it's up again.

### <b><i>Few hours later...</i></b>

The webstie is up again!

### After around 60% of tutorial

It's going very well. I'm happy for it, because:
- up-to-date, no suprises, such us unclear, ambigious or faulty instructions (quite common in tutorials, especially old and non-professional ones),
- very infomaritve content: I'm getting <b>familiar with all the basic features and functionalities </b> of Unity framework.
<b>
- new stuff I've learned:
    - basic shapes and manipulating them
    - basic hotkeys
    - rigid body,
    - some nuances in scripting,
    - how to get and apply player input,
    - how to control a camera,
    - how to apply motion to game objects.

### Done with the tutorial


I feel like I've learned a lot today. Besides the above, also the following:
<b>
- Prefabs,
- NavMeshSurface + Bake. (added to the groumd) - representing walkable area
    - Collect Objects -> Current Object Hierarchy
    - Bake anytime you add some obstacles / change in the ground
    - Agent Type -> ...Settings ->
- Mes Obstacles - used in Dynamic Obstacles
-  HUD (Heads-Up Display), or simply - some sort of UI or info, like "Count: 7"
- Manipulating components and finding them through UnityEngine methods.
- using Tags
- setting up an Enemy that is chasing the player
- collisions, events on colliions
- OnTriggerEnter(Collider collider)
- Setting up static objects, obstacles, moving/rotating/interactive objects.
