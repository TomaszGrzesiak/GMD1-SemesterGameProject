### Implemented Features

- Sound effects and background music  
- Main menu  
- A short introduction explaining the objectives of the game  

These tasks were fairly straightforward to implement.

## Unfinished Features (Final Milestone)

Unfortunately, I was not able to complete the last milestone, which included:

- Adding **two more levels**  
- Adding a **multiplayer mode**  
- Adding **enemies with AI**

Due to lack of time and other obstacles, I was also unable to complete the following features from Milestone 2. This is unfortunate, as they were well within reach and I had already implemented similar functionality during Unity tutorials:

- **Player animation**  
  - Player sprites are already available  
  - Estimated implementation time: 1–2 hours  
  - The animation should change based on the player’s movement direction

## Conclusions and Personal Reflections

This project was very interesting and provided many opportunities to learn, both in terms of game design and the practical realities of development. It highlighted how many details a developer must consider, such as asset availability and the constant need to adapt solutions when older tutorials or approaches no longer work as expected.

The experience gave me valuable insight into the importance of consistency in asset themes, game dynamics, and overall aesthetics. From a player’s perspective, these elements are crucial—ultimately, the game needs to be fun and engaging.

While I believe I have only scratched the surface compared to professional game developers, this project has already given me significant experience across many aspects of game development, including design, asset gathering, scripting, environment modeling, and animation within Unity.
