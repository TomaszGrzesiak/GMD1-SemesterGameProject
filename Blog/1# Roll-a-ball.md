# 1: Roll-a-ball tutorial, 17-02-2025

## First day of game dev!

I’m excited to learn and play with game developement. It’s interesting for many reasons, but mainly:

* it’s a mix of wide range of domains, f.x. MDA - in of it self already encompasses lots of fields that one has to take into consideration during game dev
* it’s a creative endevour - meaning - we can “unleash” some creativity and express ourselves in various manners - definately more than in most of other courses
* it develops our skillset towards interactive media in general
* it’s fun to be in this class :)

## Time:

~4-5 hours - including some extra insights and updating the blog. And ~1-2 h to setup GitHub repo and the starting the blog (GitHub pages) according to the assignmnet requirements. It took so long, because I was trying to make it fancy. It didn’t work out though (╥﹏╥). Building the app takes ages! First build to `.exe` file = 3-4 mins. Building to **webGL… at this moment it’s **10 mins, and still going.

## Roll-a-ball

### Beginnings

I tried to follow the tutorial: https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball . The showcase and promises look decent. The skillset and experience I should acquire during the tutorial seem very useful, even foundational in the lens of upcoming tasks.

Unfortunately, it the website stopped working after ~30 min. I can only see a message: "503 Service Unavailable"

Available counterpart tutorials on YouTube are ~9 years old. Too much.

Now I have to wait until it’s up again.

### Few hours later…

The website is up again!

### After around 60% of tutorial

It’s going very well. I’m happy for it, because:

* up-to-date, no suprises, such us unclear, ambigious or faulty instructions (quite common in tutorials, especially old and non-professional ones),
* very infomaritve content: I’m getting familiar with all the basic features and functionalities  of Unity framework.

### New stuff I’ve learned:

* basic shapes and manipulating them
* basic hotkeys
* rigid body
* some nuances in scripting
* how to get and apply player input
* how to control a camera
* how to apply motion to game objects.

### Done with the tutorial

I feel like I’ve learned a lot today. Besides the above, also the following:

* Prefabs
* NavMeshSurface + Bake (added to the ground) - representing walkable area
  * Collect Objects -> Current Object Hierarchy
  * Bake anytime you add some obstacles / change in the ground
  * Agent Type -> …Settings ->
* Mes Obstacles - used in Dynamic Obstacles
* HUD (Heads-Up Display), or simply - some sort of UI or info, like “Count: 7”
* Manipulating components and finding them through UnityEngine methods.
* using Tags
* setting up an Enemy that is chasing the player
* collisions, events on collisions
* `OnTriggerEnter(Collider collider)`
* Setting up static objects, obstacles, moving/rotating/interactive objects.
